1. introduction
I can identify the following essential elements in introduction:
-Lead-in to introduce the background of the topic;
-Explain why it is important to understand the similarities;
-Briefly compare the two authors' general arguments or main points;
-Point out their shared topics;
-Summarize their claims on each shared topic;
-Explain the significance of the comparison.

2. quotation
I can identify the following points:
-Use reporting verbs to introduce the authors' claims. The claims are about the shared topics and the repspective positions of the authors.
--at least one quotation sandwich with necessary explanation. The quotes can properly justify the sub-claims and well fit in the context. There is no hit-and-run quotation.

3. organization and language
-Use reporting verbs to introduce claims;
-Write with clear character and actions;
-Use cohesive signal words to connect the language and meaning between and across
sentences;
-Focus on one central topic in each paragraph of the main body;
-Write with correct grammar,variety of vocabulary and fluent sentences.
